    - I18n resource strings were removed along with the corresponding
      constructors.
    - Error codes `OSLC001..OSLC014` from Core were renamed to
      `OSLC1001..OSLC1014`, while
      codes `OSLCC001..OSLCC004` from Client were renamed into
      `OSLC2001..OSLC2014`. All OSLC4Net error codes now have 4 digits for
      consistency.
- ‚ùóÔ∏è DotNetRdfHelper is no longer static

### Deprecated

- üëâ `OSLC4Net.Client.Oslc.Resources.ChangeRequest.GetRdfTypes` and all similar

  the JSON-LD support is added.
- I18n resource strings were removed along with the corresponding
  constructors on exceptions. Also, `MessageExtractor` helpers were removed.
- log4net dependency - all logging is now done via standard `ILogger`
  abstraction.
- ServiceProviderRegistryURIs - oslc4net will no longer try to guess/compute the
  SP catalog URI.

### Fixed

- `OSLC4Net.Core.Model.IExtendedResource.GetTypes` is now annotated properly and
  should be populated correctly on deserialization.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-04-13

### Security

This release does not contain security updates.

### Added

- ‚ö°Ô∏è CI integration tests against OSLC RefImpl CM/RM based on NET Aspire
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Ability to define OSLC resource POCOs using C# properties instead of
  Java-style getters/setters.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Support for the OSLC Requirements Management 2.1 domain with property-based code.
- Added full vocabulary definitions for FOAF, DC Terms, DC Elements, LDP, PROV-O, QUDT, SKOS.
- Redirect loop protection for `OslcClient` (max 20 redirects as in
  Firefox/Blink/WebKit)
- Follow redirects on more responses statuses (was: 301, became: 301, 302, 307,
  308, and in case of GET requests, 303 too)
- ‚ùóÔ∏è `OslcResponse` can now expose multiple response resources, the `Graph` and,
  in case of error, the `oslc:Error` resource.

### Changed

- dotNetRDF dependency was updated to v3.3.1
- ‚ùóÔ∏è `OslcClient` was updated to support async operations consistently

### Deprecated

- Most non-async methods in client classes.
- Further OSLC JSON deprecations. Clients should rely on RDF instead (RDF/XML,
  Turtle)
- Old OSLC Requirements Management classes that were hand-rolled and used Java code style.

### Removed

- ‚ùóÔ∏è Multiple non-async methods in `OslcClient`
- ‚ùóÔ∏è A property exposing `OslcRestClient` in `ServiceProviderRegistryClient`

### Fixed

- Minor bug fixes to pass acceptance tests against OSLC RefImpl Change
  Management server.

### Fixed

- `Requirement.SetDecomposes()` cleared `affectedBy` by mistake.

## [0.4.5] - 2024-10-19

### Security

- üîíÔ∏è Transitive dependency System.Net.Http was set to version 4.3.4 to avoid
  failing the build when NU1903 is treated as error.
- üîíÔ∏è Transitive dependency System.Text.RegularExpressions was set to version
  4.3.1 to avoid failing the build when NU1903 is treated as error.

### Added

This release does not contain new features.

### Changed

- Significant build changes to manage package versions centrally.
- NuGet/assembly versions are now set based on the git tag name.
- üëâ "snapshot" builds how have the version similar to 999.9.9-ts.202410192025,
  where 202410192025 is a timestamp; please note that such snapshot builds are
  only available
  via [Github Packages](https://github.com/orgs/OSLC/packages?repo_name=oslc4net).

### Deprecated

This release does not introduce deprecations.

### Removed

- Dependencies on "bridge" packages added during the migration from .NET
  Framework to .NET 6:
    - System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager
    - System.Data.DataSetExtensions
    - Microsoft.CSharp

### Fixed

- Example and test project had `<IsPackable>false</IsPackable>` property set to
  prevent pushing their packages to NuGet.

## [0.4.4] - 2024-10-19

YANKED - deploy to NuGet.org did not succeed.

## [0.4.3] - 2024-10-19

### Security

This release does not contain security updates.

### Added

- Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è An example project using `OslcClient` and basic auth to retrieve a
  WorkItem (OSLC ChangeRequest) from Jazz.
- ``OslcClient::ForBasicAuth()`` factory method.
- Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è ``OslcClient.GetResourceAsync()`` strongly typed async method that
  returns `OslcResponse<T>` with either a typed resource or an error.
- Support for complex MIME type strings for content negotiation. Current
  `Accept` string is set to
  ``text/turtle;q=1.0, application/rdf+xml;q=0.9, application/n-triples;q=0.8, text/n3;q=0.7``
  by default.
- OSLC Query results now expose a `.TotalCount` property.

### Changed

- ‚ùóÔ∏è `OSLC4Net.Client` now requires `netstandard2.1` (was: `netstandard2.0`)
- Upgraded dotNetRDF
  to [v3.3.0](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

### Deprecated

- Some constructors on `OslcClient` were deprecated (around skipping TLS
  checks).
- üëâ log4net logging will be replaced with the standard
  Microsoft [ILogger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger?view=net-8.0)
  in a future release.
- Direct use of `IEnumerator` properties on `OslcQueryResponse` to iterate over
  response pages.
- Multiple symbols on OSLC Query related code with Java-like signatures (various
  `Get*` methods) and string types. Prefer C# props of type `Uri`.

### Removed

This release does not remove any features.

### Fixed

- `OslcClient` no longer overwrites most of the headers (#204). It was a similar
  issue to #19 (but happening with `OslcRestClient`).
- Ensure OSLC Query responses are processed correctly when they contain multiple
  `oslc:ResponseInfo`
  objects ([!203](https://github.com/OSLC/oslc4net/pull/203)).

## [0.4.2] - 2024-10-09

### Security

- üîíÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è `OSLC4Net.Client` now defaults to strong TLS certificate checking.
  Skipping TLS checks now requires explicit configuration.

### Added

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Support for .NET 6+ was added by migrating most of the projects in the
  solution to target `netstandard2.0`.

### Changed

- ‚ö°Ô∏è `OSLC4Net.Core` now targets `netstandard2.0`, which allows it to be used
  under .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher as well as .NET 6+.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è dotNetRDF was upgraded from v1 to v3 to enable targeting `netstandard2.0`.
    - One of the key breaking changes is that `ITriple` and `INode` no longer
      have the `.Graph` property.
    - ‚ùóÔ∏è This caused breaking changes to some of the method signatures in
      `OSLC4Net.DotNetRdfProvider` to allow the `IGraph` instance to be passed.
- `OSLC4Net.Client` now targets `netstandard2.0`.
    - ‚ùóÔ∏è The main breaking change is the replacement of the legacy
      `WebRequestHandler` with `HttpClientHandler`. This caused some
      method/constructor signatures to change.
    - ‚ùóÔ∏è `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` was replaced with a lambda
      function.
- `OSLC4Net.Query` now targets `netstandard2.0`. The Antlr3 runtime package
  targeting PCL was replaced with a package targeting NETStandard1.0 (Antlr 4
  targets NETStandard2.0).
- ‚ùóÔ∏è `JsonMediaTypeFormatter` was renamed into `OslcJsonMediaTypeFormatter` to
  better reflect its purpose (support a bespoke OSLC JSON format) and avoid
  conflict with `System.Net.Http.Formatting.MediaTypeFormatter`.
- Test projects were migrated from MSTestV2 to xUnit (except for integration
  tests for OSLC CM)

### Deprecated

- .NET 6 support is deprecated as the EOL is approaching soon. Given that all
  non-Framework libraries target `netstandard2.0`, this should have no impact
  on the users.

### Removed

- .NET 7 support was removed since the SDK has reached EOL.
- `Newtonsoft.Json` package was only used in the StockQuoteSample ASP.NET MVC
  project. Its references were removed from all other projects.

### Fixed

This release does not contain bug fixes.

## [0.4.1] - YANKED

YANKED due to NuGet deployment issues.

## [0.4.0] - YANKED

YANKED due to NuGet deployment issues.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2023-04-29

### Security

- üîíÔ∏è **Updated `log4net` in response to CVE-2018-1285 (CVSS 9.8/10).**
- üîíÔ∏è **Updated `Newtonsoft.Json` in response
  to [CWE-755](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755.html).**

### Added

- CI configuration based on Github Actions (MSBuild, NuGet, VStest).

### Changed

- üëâ Since 2017-04-15, the project is hosted on Github under the OSLC community
  org.
- The project now targets .NET 4.8 instead of .NET 4.5.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Nuget project configuration was migrated from `packages.config` to
  PackageReference.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è The StockQuoteSample was updated to ASP.NET MVC 5.
- Migrated from MSBuild-based NuGet package restore to NuGet 2.7+ Automatic
  Package Restore.
- Migrated from MSTestV1 (
  `Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework`) to MSTestV2 (
  `MSTest.Test*`).
- ‚ùóÔ∏èüëâ **`AssemblyVersion` was set to `0.3.0.0`** (from 1.0.0.0 in the v0.2.3).
  This could be a breaking change in some cases, but given that the project was
  used by a small number of people, the version being obviously wrong (given
  being present in the 0.2.3 release) and not having a Nuget release before, we
  decided to go ahead. Furthermore, switching from a direct assembly reference
  or a project reference to a Nuget package would require changes to the project
  references anyway.

### Deprecated

- Service Provider Catalog autodetection on the local host, port 8080, should
  not be relied upon, as the corresponding logic is deprecated.

### Removed

- ‚ùóÔ∏è Support for .NET 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 was dropped.

### Fixed

- `System.Net.Http.Formatting` issues were resolved by removing references to
  related SDK-provider assemblies, assembly extensions, and replacing them with
  a uniform reference to `Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client` 5.2.9.

## [0.2.3] - 2013-07-26

### Security

### Added

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Turtle support (marshalling/unmarshalling)
