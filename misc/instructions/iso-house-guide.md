### Plain English

Use Plain English to explain the subject of a document as simply and effectively as possible. Plain English is easier to read, which results in less misunderstanding and misapplication of instructions.

ISO documents have international users who often read in their non-native language. ISO documents are also often translated. Clear and concise writing avoids errors in translation. Plain English is not unprofessional or informal; it is a tool of good communication.

*   Write in short sentences and paragraphs to break up the text and make it easier to follow. Include only one idea in each sentence. Avoid sentences with more than 20 words. Include several short paragraphs per page.
*   Use frequent subclause headings and lists to split up concepts, processes and methods into smaller pieces. If a list is very long or has complex subdivision, try to break it into several shorter lists.
*   Use tables and figures to illustrate anything that is difficult to explain in words. Avoid very complicated tables and figures. Try to use several shorter tables that can each fit onto one page. Subfigures can be used for the individual components of a complex figure.
*   Use punctuation effectively to clarify meaning. For example, a comma creates a pause in a sentence that helps the user to follow the flow of words.
*   Use ISO verbal forms to easily identify requirements, recommendations, permissions, possibility and capability and external constraints in the text. Alternative expressions are not always easily understood in place of the ISO verbal forms. See [ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, Clause 7](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, Clause 7").
*   Every technical sector uses specific terminology (i.e. jargon) and it is appropriate to use technical language in ISO documents. However, it can be helpful to provide a simple explanation for technical terms. Use Plain English to write the definition of these terms in Clause 3. Do not assume that all users will have the same level of understanding as the members of an ISO Technical Committee.

### Tone

*   Give instructions using direct, active verbs. For example, the following instruction is clearer in the second version:
    *   “Each test sample obtained in accordance with A.4.1 shall be weighed to the nearest 0,1 g and the different defects shall be separated into the bowls.”
    *   “Weigh, to the nearest 0,1 g, each of the test samples obtained in accordance with A.4.1. Separate the different defects into the bowls.”
*   Use the present tense by default. Only use past or future tenses when specifying something that happened in the past or will happen in the future.
*   Use an impersonal tone. Avoid “I”, “we”, “you” and other personal pronouns.
*   Remove extra details that do not help the user to implement the document and make the document longer than it needs to be. For example, details about the development of the document (e.g. N documents, meetings, individual contributors, decisions taken) are of interest to the members of the Working Group but not the document user.

### Grammar

#### General

Grammar is everything known about the structure of a language. It is a big topic beyond the scope of any style guide. However, here are answers to some common questions.

#### Agreement of the verb with the subject

In any clause of a sentence, the verb must agree with its subject in terms of singular or plural. For example:

*   “The method is used”: singular subject with singular verb.
*   “The methods are used”: plural subject with plural verb.
*   “Method A and procedure B are used”: two singular subjects with plural verb.

For singular collective nouns (nouns that refer to a group of individuals, e.g. organization, top management, government, committee), the subject can be treated as either singular or plural depending on whether the group is described as a single, impersonal entity or as a collection of individual members. For example:

*   “The committee was elected in March”: refers to the committee as a single entity.
*   “The committee were in heated debate”: refers to the actions of the individual members of the committee.

When the collective noun is followed by a [non-defining relative clause](#iso-hs-s-text-r-g-defining), use the relative pronoun “which” for a singular subject and “who” for a plural subject:

*   “This requires some training of the team, which normally consists of two, three or four people, when all tissues are sampled.”
*   “Members of the team, who are located throughout the force, are used to help operational officers to respond to various situations.”

#### Use of (s)

Avoid using “(s)” to express the possible plurality of a term unless it can be used simply, as it can overcomplicate a sentence. The plural form is usually sufficient to convey the meaning, for example:

*   “Ensure the samples are stored in suitable conditions.”

Alternatively, the phrase “one or more” can be used:

*   “Ensure that one or more samples are stored in suitable conditions.”  

If it is necessary to be precise and to include a term in both plural and singular form, ensure that the rest of the sentence is adapted appropriately, with verbs placed in brackets corresponding to noun endings in brackets. For example:

*   “Ensure the sample(s) is (are) stored in suitable conditions.”

#### Defining and non-defining relative clauses (i.e. using “that” or “which”)

A relative clause is the part of a sentence used to describe a noun. It comes immediately after the noun it describes. There are two types of relative clauses:

*   A defining clause identifies who or what is being discussed. It cannot be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. It is not enclosed with commas.
    *   “The ISIN is allocated to those products that are not financial instruments when they are underlying or reference assets.”
*   A non-defining clause adds information to the sentence and can be omitted without changing the meaning. It is enclosed with commas.
    *   “The ISIN is allocated to these products, which are not financial instruments, when they are underlying or reference assets.”

In the first example sentence, the ISIN is allocated only to those products that are not financial instruments. The relative clause (“that are not financial instruments”) defines the products to which the ISIN is allocated. Removing it would change the meaning of the sentence.

In the second example sentence, the ISIN is allocated to the specified products, none of which are financial instruments, and the relative clause (“, which are not financial instruments,”) merely provides additional information. If it was removed, the sentence would retain its meaning.

Either “that” or “which” can be used to introduce a defining clause. However, “which” is always used to introduce a non-defining clause.

#### A or an

The choice depends on the sound of what follows:

*   “a” is used before a word or abbreviated term beginning with a consonant sound, e.g. a bank, a European, a hospital, a hotel, a one-term appointment, a user.
*   “an” is used before a word or abbreviated term beginning with a vowel sound, e.g. an organization, an ISO meeting, an NGO, an XML file, or an “h” if the “h” is silent, e.g. an hour. 

#### Affect or effect

Affect (verb) means to have an influence on, e.g. “The use of method A affects the result”.

Effect (verb) means to cause or to accomplish, e.g. “The use of method A effects a change in the system”.

Effect (noun) means a change or result caused by something or someone, e.g. “Ecotoxicological test systems are applied to obtain information about the effects of contaminants in soil”.

#### Assure or ensure

Assure (verb) means to remove someone’s doubts, e.g. “When a customer wants to be assured that the quality of a lot conforms to the quality specified, sampling should be carried out in accordance with ISO 1234”.

Ensure (verb) means to make sure of something, e.g. “The Technical Committee defines its method to ensure the International Standard is suitable for the intended use”.

#### Fewer or less

Use “fewer” for things that can be counted, e.g. fewer test samples, fewer days.

Use “less” for things that cannot be counted, expressions of time or measurement, and for numbers when they appear on their own, e.g. less test equipment, less time, less than 10 min, less than 70 ml, less than 20.

#### It’s and other contractions

Contractions such as it’s, they’ll and they’d create an informal tone and are not appropriate for ISO documents. Use the full forms instead.

#### Respectively

“Respectively” is an adverb that is often misused. It means “in the order given” and is only used if the sentence would be unclear without it. For example:

*   “Samples 1 and 2 shall contain 100 ml and 50 ml of ethanol, respectively.”

In this case, “respectively” is used to attribute each of the two values individually to the two samples in the order in which they appear, i.e. sample 1: 100 ml, sample 2: 50 ml.

### Spelling and wording

#### Spelling

ISO documents use Oxford English spelling, which is British spelling in combination with the suffix ‑ize (rather than ‑ise) for about 200 verbs that generally originate from the Greek -izo suffix, e.g. organize, standardize. For other words, use an “s”, e.g. analyse, paralyse. In case of doubt, follow the spelling of the Oxford English Dictionary. For an online version, see [www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com). Use spelling consistently throughout a document.

Spelling exceptions are allowed for technical reasons. For example, in a piece of code, the US spelling of “color” is required for the code to function correctly.

| ISO spelling rule | Examples, exceptions and further information |
| --- | --- |
| Use **‑ize** | organize (organization), standardize (standardization), harmonize, recognize, realize |
| Use **‑ise** | advertise, advise, arise, comprise, compromise, enterprise, exercise, franchise, revise, supervise |
| Use **‑yse** and not -yze | analyse, breathalyse, catalyse, dialyse, electrolyse, hydrolyse, paralyse, psychoanalyse |
| Use ‑**re** and not ‑er | calibre, centre, fibre, litre, metre\*, spectre, theatre  <br>\*except use meter for a measuring instrument |
| Use **‑our** and not ‑or | colour, favour, flavour, harbour, honour, humour, labour, neighbour, rumour |
| Use **‑ogue** and not ‑og | analogue, catalogue, dialogue, homologue, monologue |
| Use **“ll”** not “l” spellings of certain words | cancel – cancelled, cancelling  <br>label – labelled, labelling  <br>enrol – enrolled, enrolling (but: enrolment)  <br>fulfil – fulfilled, fulfilling (but: fulfilment)  <br>model – modelled, modelling  <br>signal – signalled, signalling  <br>travel – travelled, travelling, traveller |
| Use **‑ae**, **\-oe** and not ‑e spellings of certain words | aesthetic, anaemia, anaesthetic, archaeology, haematology, orthopaedics, paediatrics  <br>foetal, manoeuvre, oestrogen |
| Use the **‑e** spellings of certain words | acknowledgement, ageing, judgement\*  <br>\*except use judgment in a legal context |
| For nouns, use the suffix **‑ence** and not ‑ense | defence, licence, offence, pretence  <br>But note: defensive, offensive, pretension |
| Use different spellings for the noun and the verb forms of certain words | licence (noun) – to license (verb)  <br>practice (noun) – to practise (verb) |
| Use **programme** and not program\* | \*except use program for computer programs |
| Use **Petri** (dish) not petri or Pétri or pétri |     |
| Use **sulfur** and not sulphur  <br>Use **sulfate** and not sulphate  <br>Use **sulfide** and not sulphide | Reason: ISO documents follow the spelling used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in their periodic table of the elements (element 16): [iupac.org](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/ "IUPAC - Periodic table of elements") |
| Use **artefact** and not artifact |     |
| Use **focused** and not focussed |     |

#### Foreign spelling

Follow the spelling of proper nouns and words from foreign languages, including accented letters, cedillas, ligatures or other special marks and any alphabetical forms that do not normally occur in English.

As specified in [ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.3](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor103 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.3"):

“The names of organizations and their abbreviated forms, shall be written as used by those organizations.”

Reproduce the names of foreign companies as used by the company itself, with all the appropriate characters (French accents, Spanish tildes, etc.), e.g. Crédit Agricole, Compañía Española de Petróleos S.A., Polmos Żyrardów.

These characters are also used in headings and on capital letters.

#### Latin and Greek wording

Avoid the use of Latin words as far as possible. Use [Plain English](#iso-hs-s-text-r-plain-english "ISO House Style - plain english") instead.

Do not italicize commonly used Latin expressions, e.g. a priori, in situ, in vitro.

Italicize Latin words used for scientific terms, e.g. species, bacteria, plants. For example, “This document describes a horizontal method for the detection of _Salmonella_ spp. in food”.

Many nouns (particularly from Latin) retain their original plurals; others have taken on the anglicized “s” ending. In some cases, both forms are still used.

For Latin and Greek words, use the English plural if one exists, e.g. forums, stadiums, statuses. Otherwise, use the appropriate foreign plural forms that are still commonly used.

*   addendum – addenda
*   analysis – analyses
*   axis – axes
*   basis – bases
*   corrigendum – corrigenda
*   crisis – crises
*   criterion – criteria
*   curriculum – curricula
*   datum – data\*
*   genus – genera
*   medium – media
*   memorandum – memoranda
*   millennium – millennia
*   nucleus – nuclea
*   phenomenon – phenomena
*   series – series
*   species – species
*   spectrum – spectra
*   stratum – strata

\*Data is the plural of the Latin word datum. In modern English usage, it is often treated as a mass noun with a singular verb. ISO style is to use the plural form: “The data are clear”.

In some cases, the choice of plural depends on the context of the sentence:

*   antenna – antennae (insects), but antennas (aerial)
*   appendix – appendices (in books), but appendixes (anatomy)
*   formula – formulae (maths), but formulas (general)
*   index – indices (maths), but indexes (in books)

#### Names of countries, territories and currencies

Codes for countries, dependencies, other areas of particular geopolitical interest and their subdivisions are specified by ISO 3166 (parts [1](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:3166:-1:ed-4:v1:en "ISO 3166-1:2020(en) Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions — Part 1: Country code"), [2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:3166:-2:ed-4:v1:en "ISO 3166-2:2020(en) Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions — Part 2: Country subdivision code"), [3](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:3166:-3:ed-3:v1:en "ISO 3166-3:2020(en) Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions — Part 3: Code for formerly used names of countries")) and are available to view on the Online Browsing Platform: [www.iso.org/obp](https://www.iso.org/obp "obp"). Select “country codes” and “search” to see the full list.

For example, use:

*   the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and not North Korea;
*   the Republic of Korea (ROK) and not South Korea;
*   the Russian Federation and not Russia;
*   Viet Nam and not Vietnam.

As exceptions it is permitted to use:

*   the United Kingdom (UK) and not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
*   the United States (US) and not the United States of America (USA).

Codes for countries’ currencies are specified by [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:4217:ed-8:v1:en "ISO 4217:2015(en) Codes for the representation of currencies") and are available to download from the ISO 4217 Maintenance Agency: [www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html](https://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html "Country code by ISO 4217").

Use the [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:4217:ed-8:v1:en "ISO 4217:2015(en) Codes for the representation of currencies") codes rather than currency symbols.

#### IT terms

Use “online” and not “on-line”.

Use “cybersecurity” and not “cyber security” or “cyber-security”.

Use lower case for general IT terms (e.g. “file format”, “key wrap”, “syntax”), see [Capitals.](#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-capitals "Capitals")

#### Conformity and conformity-related terms

The word “compliance” is used in connection with legislation and regulations, which are not generally mentioned in ISO documents. See [Legal statements](#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-legal "Legal statements").

Use the word “conformity” when referring to requirements. The phrase “in accordance with” can also be used for expressing conformity-related requirements. For example:

*   “Interlocking and guard locking devices shall conform to ISO 14119.”
*   “Ports and stud ends conforming to this document are not intended to connect with ports and stud ends that conform to ISO 1179 or threads that conform to ISO 7-1.”
*   “The relative density of the hose inner tube shall not exceed 2,155 when tested in accordance with ISO 7258.”

ISO/CASCO, the _Committee on conformity assessment_, has produced definitions for conformity-related terminology, e.g. “competence” and “assessment”. If there is a need to define this kind of terminology in a standard, search the [Online Browsing Platform](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ "Online Browsing Platform") to find the CASCO definition to use as a source. Do not develop a new definition for the document. Contact CASCO at an early stage when developing a standard containing conformity assessment elements: [CASCO@iso.org](mailto:CASCO@iso.org)

#### In accordance with or according to

The expressions “in accordance with” and “according to” are frequently used interchangeably in everyday English. 

However, for consistency in ISO documents, when expressing a requirement (using “shall” or the imperative form) use the phrase “in accordance with” rather than “according to”, e.g. “The method shall be validated in accordance with ISO 1234”. 

#### Inclusive language

[ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.6](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.6"), requires that inclusive terminology be used wherever possible.

Guidance on the use of inclusive terminology in ISO and IEC documents and a list of non-inclusive terms and recommended alternatives are provided on [the ISO website](https://www.iso.org/resources/publicly-available-resources.html?t=1LSJG9ms7Qyjks_YM6YiW5Q_pyDJxl2UR4ZDkyWhbJ-diDNZWWuXsKerDxXDhj_T&view=documents#section-isodocuments-top "Inclusive terminology").

Feedback or questions concerning these resources can be sent to [inclusive@iso.org](mailto:inclusive@iso.org?subject=Inclusive%20terminology "Inclusive terminology")

#### Capitals

Use capitals sparingly. The use of many capitals makes a page look bureaucratic or pretentious, especially when ordinary words such as method or framework are unnecessarily capitalized.

Proper nouns are always capitalized, e.g. Reynolds number.

Otherwise, nouns are given in lower case, i.e. words such as committee, organization, report, government only have a capital when part of a full title, e.g. the ISO Council.

If the full form of an abbreviated term is not a proper noun, the abbreviated term is generally presented in capital letters, e.g. DMA, but the full written form is not given initial capital letters, e.g. decision-making application and not Decision-Making Application.

Capital letters are used when referring to an “International Standard” and to the elements of a document, e.g. Introduction, Scope, Bibliography, “see Clause 6”, “an example can be found in Annex B”.

In titles and headings, only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns, acronyms or initialisms.

#### Family or suite of standards

In marketing material, documents that are thematically linked but are not a series and have different numbers are sometimes referred to as a “family of standards” or "suite of standards". For example, the ISO 9000 family includes ISO 9000, ISO 9001, ISO 10001, ISO 19011, etc.  

However, in technical documents such as International Standards, which need to be precise, the terms “family of standards” and "suite of standards" are too vague, unlike the term “series”, which represents one document split into a series of parts, e.g. ISO 10241‑1, ISO 10241‑2.

Use instead the following wording: “documents on \[subject area\] developed by \[ISO committee\]”. For additional clarification, a list of the relevant documents can be included in the Introduction, if appropriate.

### Abbreviated terms, abbreviations and contractions

#### Abbreviated terms (acronyms and initialisms)

ISO documents use the wording “abbreviated terms” to refer to both acronyms and initialisms. They are formed from the initial letters of other words.

NOTE Acronyms are strings of initial letters pronounced as a word (CEN, UNESCO). Initialisms are not pronounced as a word (IEC, USA).

Do not use the term “abbreviations” in this context because this refers instead to shortened words, see [Abbreviations and contractions](#iso-hs-s-text-r-a-abbreviations "Abbreviation and contractions").

[ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4"), includes instructions on presenting abbreviated terms:

“The use of abbreviated terms shall be consistent throughout the document.

If a list of abbreviated terms is not given in the document (see Clause 17), then the first time that an abbreviated term is used, the full term shall be given with the abbreviated term following in brackets.

EXAMPLE 1 ... the weighted root mean square (RMS) width of the active output interface optical spectrum …”

Exceptions can be made when the abbreviated term is so familiar that it is used more often than the full form, e.g. AFNOR, ANSI, IMF, NATO, OECD, UNESCO, and when in addition the full form does not provide extra clarity, e.g. DNA, HIV.

If a list of abbreviated terms is given, it is not necessary to spell out the full term at the first use (but it is allowed).

There is no need to give the abbreviated form of a term if it is not referred to again.

Avoid repeatedly spelling out abbreviated terms, except when the abbreviated term is used in both the document Title and Scope, in terms and definitions, and in clause/subclause headings.

As the document Title and Scope are often used independently of the whole document, use the full term followed by the abbreviated term in parentheses in both cases. Not all users will be familiar with the abbreviated term, so this will help to clarify things. If the term occurs more than once in either the Title or Scope, then use the abbreviated term alone for the second and all subsequent instances.

In terms and definitions, the full term is spelled out at the first use in each entry. This is because terms and definitions are available as standalone items on the [Online Browsing Platform](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ "Online Browsing Platform").

In clause/subclause headings, using the full term rather than the abbreviated form can lead to overly long or complex headings. Either form can be used providing its use is consistent.

As specified in [ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4"):

“Any abbreviated term should be in upper case letters, without a full stop after each letter.

EXAMPLE 2 “RH” for “relative humidity”.”

Do not use capital letters for the full term unless it is a proper noun, see [Capitals](#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-capitals "Capitals").

As specified in [ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, 8.4"):

“Occasionally, abbreviated terms in common use are written differently, either for historical or for technical reasons.

Technical specifications regarding marking may impose other requirements.”

For example, the abbreviated terms “scuba” and “sonar” are not written in capital letters.

If the abbreviated term can be pronounced (e.g. CEN, ISO), it does not generally require the definite article (“the”). Otherwise, it is preceded by an article (e.g. a GPS, the UN, a URN, the WHO).

The plural form of an abbreviated term generally uses a lower-case “s”, e.g. for critical control point (CCP): “the plan shall be given for each CCP” and “critical limits as CCPs shall be specified”. Exceptions include abbreviated terms that are already plural, e.g. comma-separated values (CSV), and management system standard, which is always MSS without an “s” whether singular or plural.

#### Abbreviations and contractions

Abbreviations and contractions are shortened words. These are not included in a list of abbreviated terms.

An abbreviation has the beginning of a word but not the end. Examples of abbreviations are “min.”, “max.”, “lab.”. Put a full stop after the abbreviation and capitalize it in the same way as the unabbreviated word. Only use abbreviations in tables and figures; write words in full in the text.

A contraction has the first and last letters of a word and sometimes other letters in between. Contractions have no full stops. Examples are Mr, Mrs, Ms, Rd, dept, Dr, St. They are also capitalized like the uncontracted word. An exception is “no.” (from the Italian “numero”, for number), which is a contraction but has a full stop to avoid confusion with the word “no”. But the plural, “nos”, is formed like other contractions without a full stop.

##### e.g., i.e. and etc.

These common Latin shortened forms are used regularly in ISO documents. They are punctuated as shown: 

*   e.g. (exempli gratia, for example); 
*   i.e. (id est, that is); 
*   etc. (et cetera, and other things). 

e.g. and i.e. are not interchangeable and serve different functions. 

Use “e.g.” when giving an example in brackets or at the end of a sentence: 

*   “The results can be affected by the storage conditions (e.g. time, temperature).”
*   “Documented information should be controlled to ensure it is adequately protected, e.g. from loss of confidentiality, improper use or loss of integrity.” 

Use “for example” when the example is given as part of the sentence or to introduce a list:

*   “Applicable actions can include, for example, the provision of training or the re-assignment of personnel.” 
*   “Processing can involve a range of processes, including, for example:   
    —   addition of stabilizing agents;   
    —   homogenization prior to packaging.” 

Use “i.e.” when clarifying a point or explaining something in another way:

*   “Liquefied extinguishants shall be provided as a pure extinguishant, i.e. not pressurized with nitrogen.”
*   “F is the operating force (i.e. the force applied on brake lever or pedal).” 

Never include both e.g. and etc. in the same sentence clause. For example, “e.g. managers, technicians, experts, etc.” is not acceptable. 

##### Alternating current, direct current and radio frequency

For a.c. and d.c.:

*   when used as an adjective, use instead “AC” and “DC”, respectively, e.g. “AC transmitter”;
*   when used as a noun, use the full forms “alternating current” and “direct current”, respectively, at least in the first instance. The abbreviated terms “a.c.” and “d.c.” can be used subsequently.

Do not use the term “r.f.” as it is obsolete:

*   when used as an adjective, use instead the abbreviation “RF” or the full form “radio-frequency” (with a hyphen);
*   when used as a noun, use instead the full form “radio frequency” (without a hyphen).

##### ca. (approximately)

Do not use “ca.” as an abbreviation of approximately. Write instead “approximately” in the text or “≈” in tables. Do not write “~” instead of “≈” in a table.

### Punctuation

#### General

Punctuation helps make meaning clear, but there are changes in practice over time and different writers adopt different approaches. The priority for ISO documents is to be easily understandable and unambiguous. Use punctuation consistently within a document.

#### Use of /

A forward slash is often used in English to express “either or both” of two options. The meaning can be ambiguous, especially in translation to other languages where the “/” is not a recognized punctuation mark.

Avoid using a forward slash or the wording “and/or” in a document to avoid confusion and misapplication. Use the construction “either x or y, or both” instead.

#### and or &

ISO documents do not use the ampersand (&) in ordinary running text within the document or in the document title, table titles or figure titles. Use the word “and” instead.

Exceptionally, the ampersand is found in certain limited cases, including within code and abbreviated terms. 

#### Apostrophes

When used to indicate possession, the apostrophe comes before the “s” in the singular and after it in the plural:

*   “The sample’s identification number…”
*   “The users’ feedback…”

The meaning can often be made clearer by rewording, e.g. “the identification number of the sample”.

For plural nouns not ending in “s”, the apostrophe comes before the “s”, e.g. “people’s opinions”.

Phrases such as “two weeks’ time”, “six months’ development”, “nine years’ worth” need apostrophes.

Do not use an apostrophe for plurals of names, abbreviated terms, numbers or words not usually used as nouns, e.g. two Johns, URNs, 1990s, the three Rs, dos and don’ts.

Sometimes clarity is needed when letters and symbols are referred to as objects, e.g. subtract the xs from the ys. In these cases, use quote marks and not apostrophes, e.g. subtract the “x”s from the “y”s.

#### Commas

ISO documents do not use the Oxford (serial) comma before the last item in a list, unless it is needed to avoid ambiguity. For example:

“The capture, measurement and analysis of the data should be automated” is an unambiguous list of three items and does not need an Oxford comma.

“The procedural steps are sample preparation, instrument set-up and calibration, and image capture” requires an Oxford comma to be clear that “calibration” is part of the second step and is not part of the “image capture” third step.

#### Full stops

Use plenty of full stops. They keep sentences short. This helps the user. Do not use full stops between letters in abbreviated terms or at the end of clause/subclause headings, table titles, figure titles, normative references or bibliographic entries.

#### Hyphens

Hyphens in words or phrases can improve clarity and avoid misinterpretation. Use hyphens consistently throughout a document or series.

In case of doubt, follow the spelling of the Oxford English Dictionary. For an online version, see [www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com).

##### Prefixes

A word formed from a prefix plus a word is not usually hyphenated unless the word begins with the same letter as the last letter of the prefix:

*   multilateral, bilingual, misled, subclause, interlaboratory;
*   anti-inflammatory, pre-eminent, re-enter (but interrelated, microorganism).

Words beginning with co- (meaning joint), anti-, non- and ex- (meaning former) tend to keep their hyphen, e.g. co-worker, anti-reflective, non-existent, ex-president (but cooperate, coordinate, antidote).

Prefixes before a capitalized name, number or date use a hyphen, e.g. sub-Saharan, pre-2000.

##### Suffixes

Words formed with suffixes are generally not hyphenated, e.g. sizeable, hyphenate, fruitful, patronize, greenish, kindness, twofold (but industry-wide, oil-based paint, sugar-free syrup, list-style functionality).

##### Compounds

Compound nouns are usually presented as a single word with no hyphen or as two separate words, e.g. bypass, website, labour market. Exceptions include cross-reference and decision-making.

Compound adjectives that modify the noun are hyphenated when they come before the noun, e.g. up-to-date figures, medium-term outlook, energy-deficient countries, third-party assessment, well-known problem.

Do not use a hyphen when the compound comes after the noun, e.g. “The figures were up to date”, “changes in the medium term”, “the result is well known”.

Do not hyphenate compound adjectives when the first word is an adverb ending in -ly, e.g. newly discovered planet, finely ground powder.

#### Lists

ISO documents use two formats for lists.

*   If the list comprises several sentences, then use the following list format.
    *   The introductory sentence is a complete sentence and ends with a colon or a full stop.
    *   The list items are complete sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a full stop.
*   If the list comprises one sentence broken into a list format, then:
    *   the introductory sentence is a partial sentence and preferably ends with a colon;
    *   the list items start in lower case and end with a semicolon (preferred) or a comma, used consistently;
    *   the penultimate list item does not include “and” or “or”, except to avoid ambiguity;
    *   the final list item ends with a full stop.

EXAMPLES  
When preparing the Foreword, add all document-specific elements into the fixed text.

*   The number and title of the responsible TC and SC.
*   A statement of collaboration with another organization, if relevant.
*   A statement of revision if the document cancels and replaces another document. Include any related published amendments or corrigenda that are also cancelled and replaced. The revision statement shall briefly specify the main changes between editions.

When reviewing draft text, ensure that for each table there is:

*   a consecutive table number;
*   a concise table title;
*   a cross-reference within the text; it is recommended to include a sentence above the table to explain its relevance to the user.

A list can be subdivided up to four levels. If more levels are required, consider using a table or splitting into several shorter lists.

A list can be numbered or unnumbered.

For an unnumbered list, an em dash (“—”) is used for the bullet symbol at all four levels.

There can be unlimited unnumbered lists per clause/subclause. 

Using numbered lists enables specific list items to be cross-referenced, e.g. “see 5.4 a)”.

The default order for a numbered list is a), b), c) for the first level; 1), 2), 3) for the second level; i), ii), iii) for the third level; and a), b), c) for the fourth level.

Avoid having more than one numbered list in a clause/subclause. If a second numbered list is necessary, insert a new clause/subclause to separate it from the first list or use an unnumbered list. 

Try to keep lists short so that they are easy to use. If a list requires a lot of subdivision or runs over several pages, try to break it down into several shorter, simpler lists. 

No punctuation is required if the list items are very short (one or two words each) or if the bulleted list is in a table, for example:

| **Targets for productive capacity (area A)** | **Indicator** |
| --- | --- |
| (a) increased value addition in natural resource-based industries | — industry, value added (constant 2000 USD)<br><br>— industry, value added (annual % growth)<br><br>— GDP per person employed (constant 1990 PPP USD)<br><br>— employment in industry (% of total employment) |

#### Quotation marks

ISO uses double quotation marks. For quotes inside quotes, use single quotation marks.

When the quote is a full sentence and stands completely alone, put the punctuation mark (e.g. full stop) before the closing quotation mark.

*   “The ‘neutrality principle’ means that the content of the standard shall not state a preference for a form or one type of assessment over another.”

When the quote is within a sentence and the punctuation mark is part of the quote, keep it within the quotation marks.

*   The answer to the question: “Are the references normative or informative?” depends on how each document has been cross-referenced in the text.

When the quote is within a sentence and the punctuation mark is not part of the quote, place it outside the final quotation mark.

*   Content such as an excel sheet can be processed as an “electronic attachment”; it is uploaded to the ISO Standards Maintenance Portal as part of a published document.

#### Em dashes

Use spaced em dashes (—) between the elements in titles and between figure or table numbers and titles:

*   “Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Dimensional measuring equipment — Part 2: Design and metrological characteristics of calliper depth gauges”
*   “Figure 1 — Example design of a vernier calliper depth gauge (slider with locking screw)”
*   “Table 1 — Typical dimensions of calliper depth gauges”

#### En dashes

Use closed-up en dashes (–) in ranges in references, e.g. “pp. 45–49”.

Spaced en dashes can be used as parenthetical dashes, e.g. “The indication can be either analogue – vernier scale or circular scale – or digital”.

Use an en dash instead of a hyphen between two names to show joint authorship or ownership, e.g. “The ISO–UN agreement”.


### Numbers, values and dates

#### General

The rules for the representation of numbers and values are given in [ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, Clause 9](https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111 "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2021, Clause 9").

#### Numbers

In general, write numbers as words up to nine and use digits after that. However, exceptions can be made to improve readability.

Be consistent within sentences, e.g. “Fill three flasks with liquid A and eleven flasks with liquid B”.

Use words for approximations, e.g. “794 people” but “about four hundred people”.

Use digits with units of measurement, amounts of money and ages, e.g. “A 9-year-old boy weighed 30 kg”.

Use digits if numbers are being compared, e.g. “The resolution was adopted by 8 votes to 6, with 5 abstentions”.

Always use digits with the percentage symbol (%), e.g. “an increase of 5 %”.

In text, use “per cent” not “percent” (two words) but “percentage”. For example, “expressed in per cent”, “down by half a per cent”; “the percentage of cases” or “a small percentage increase”.

Use “to” instead of a hyphen between digits, even in tables, e.g. “5 mm to 10 mm”.

Use words if the number starts a sentence, e.g. “Eleven samples should be taken”. There is no need to also give the digits in brackets following the words.

If the number is very long, try to redraft the sentence, e.g. rather than “One thousand one hundred and four people were tested” write “Testing was carried out on 1 104 people”.

Put the currency code in front of the amount.  Write “USD 100 million” rather than “USD 100 000 000” to avoid a string of zeros, except in tables.

Use “one billion” for “1 000 million”.

Sometimes using a variety helps to make the meaning clear, e.g. “Three 2-week courses followed the six 4-week courses”.

Write first, second, third rather than firstly, secondly, thirdly.

Write “replace the third paragraph” and not “replace paragraph 3”.

Do not use a hyphen instead of a minus symbol.

#### Dates

In text, write “31 October 2020” (day, month, year; no comma between month and year; no 31st or 23rd or 5th).

For a duration of time, write:

*   “10 to 15 March” and not “from 10–15 March”
*   “2020 to 2030” and not “2020–2030” or “2020–30”
*   “the twentieth century” and not “the 20th century”
*   “the twenty-first century” and not “the 21st century”

In tables or figures, use the format “2020-10-31” (YYYY-MM-DD), as specified in [ISO 8601-1](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8601:-1:ed-1:v1:en). Avoid ambiguous phrases such as “last year” or “recently” since a publication is likely to remain in use for several years. Give the date instead.
